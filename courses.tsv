1	PHYS 373	Quantum Information and Quantum Computing	PHYS	Fall	2020	UG	No	Quantum Mechanics is well known for its counterintuitive and seemingly paradoxical predictions. Despite its failure to give us a clear, intuitive picture of the world, the theory is remarkably successful at predicting the outcomes of experiments, although those predictions are probabilistic rather than deterministic. Because of its unparalleled success, the thorny issues about the theory's foundations were often ignored during its first fifty years. Recent advances in both theory and experiment have again brought these issues to the fore. This course will review some of the most interesting and intriguing facets of quantum mechanics and its potential applications to information and computing. Topics to be covered will include the Schrödinger cat paradox and the quantum measurement problem; Bell's inequalities, entanglement, and related phenomena that establish the “weirdness” of quantum mechanics; secure communication using quantum cryptography; and how quantum computers (if built) can solve certain problems much more efficiently than classical ones. We will also explore recent experiments in which quantum phenomena appear on the macroscopic scale, as well as technological progress towards building a large-scale, general-purpose quantum computer. The early part of the semester will consist of synchronous and asynchronous lectures with multiple "clicker" questions. The later part of the course will be taught seminar style with in-depth reading and discussion of research articles.

51	N/A	Quantum Computing	CS	Fall	2019	UG	No	Physicists and philosophers have been trying to understand the strangeness of the subatomic world as revealed by quantum theory since its inception back in the 1920s; but it wasn't until the 1980s—more than a half-century after the development of the theory—that computer scientists first began to suspect that quantum physics might hold profound implications for computing, as well, and that its inherent weirdness might possibly be transformed into a source of immense computational power. This dawning realization was followed soon afterward by key theoretical and practical advances, including the discovery of several important algorithms for quantum computers that could potentially revolutionize (and disrupt) the cryptographic systems protecting practically all of our society's electronic banking, commerce, telecommunications, and national security systems. Around the same time, researchers succeeded in building the first working quantum computers, albeit on a very small scale.

86	EECS598	Quantum Information, Probability and Computing	ENG, CS	Winter	2020	GR	Yes	The failures of classical theories to explain important physical phenomena led to revolutionary and unprecedented changes in our thinking, and, in turn, to the development of quantum mechanics in the first half of the twentieth century. It turns out that the laws of quantum mechanics lead to a new theory of probability (quantum probability) which is a non-commutative generalization of classical theory of probability. It was long believed that information processing and computing were solely mathematical constructs and as such were independent of nature and the laws of quantum mechanics. In the 1980s this assumption was found to be untrue, and the consequences have been profound. The introduction of quantum mechanics into communications and computation has produced new paradigms (quantum information) and some unforeseen results in the fields of computation, communications and learning. For example, quantum algorithms have now been found for factoring composite numbers (Shor's algorithms 1994). In contrast, there are no known practical (i.e., polynomial time) classical solutions for the problem. Moreover, recently quantum probability models have been proposed for human cognition to explain question-order-effects in polling and violations of rational decision theory.	https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EECS_598_Quantum_Info.pdf	1		quantum mechanics, quantum circuits, quantum gates, entanglement, teleportation, Bell's theorem, quantum computation, quantum algorithms, error correction, quantum data compression, Von Neumann entropy, quantum communication
